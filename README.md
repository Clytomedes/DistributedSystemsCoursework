# DistributedSystemsCoursework
A Coursework that completed while attending the University of Southampton.

The Courseowrk was to create a Smart Metering System using Java RMI. It was to include a Meter, a Server, and a Broker. More information about the project can be found in the PDF that is supplied.

To run the code, you have to first start a Server, and then either a Client or a Broker. Each of the respective classes have main methods Server.java, Client.java, Broker.java.

From there you can see all of the code working.
